# Refund Request

Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing to you to speak about my **dissatisfaction** with the **Web Design Course** I attended. I attended the course with the expectation of learning more about advanced web design and development, but after the first few classes, I realized that all the topics that were handled were topics that I already knew. Unfortunately, the teacher was not able to provide me with diffrent knowledge or Tasks, because he was too focused on the other students who were not familiar with the topics.

I dont want to force the teacher to rush through the topics for that would be unfair to the other students, yet i do see **no point in attending** the course further.

Yours sincerely,
